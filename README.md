# Connect the frontend to Post-BOOK API backend

In this project we will connect our front end application to the Express.Js backend application. 



## What you will be doing

This project will allow you to practise using:

> CORS 
> Client side requests to the backend
> Configuring application to allow cross origin requests. 

This project assumes you've already had experience with:

> - ExpressJS Routing
> - Http methods
> - React

(feel free to use bootstrap or any other library to mark up the list beautifully )
